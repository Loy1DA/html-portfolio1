<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Eric Loy. This is my first attempt at making a career swtich into the technology field. I come from a background of military service and working in the construction field, both of which I loved very much. Over the last year or so, I've paid close attention to the growing demand for people in the IT world. It seems to me that the opportunities this field displays are just what I need to level up my life, to add to my tool bag of tricks so to speak. I look forward to opening this new door and the chance to meet the wonderful minds behind the greatest thing since sliced bread, the internet.

<p>As I begin this journey, I'd like to take this chance to say thank you to Miss Angela for creating the course I'm using to make this possible. I know that this will require hard work, discipline, and determination in order to complete the goal. I am ready to embrace the challenge. They always say that fear is only a four letter word. I say that just on the other side of fear stands all of the dreams you've ever wished for... so it's time to go get them!</p>

<p>Throughout the course of this program, I will be building projects and adding them to my PortFolio. I would like to state, I never intended for the exercises to be viewed by potential employers, so please DO NOT take the content in these projects as a representation of who I am. I was simply having fun putting it all together. My goal is to have you find some humor in it as well! I thank you for taking the time to read this. I surely hope that you will enjoy looking through my portfolio.</p>

<p>Thanks again. </p>
